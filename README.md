# 🍬 Candy Survey Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the **2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy survey**, where respondents rated various types of candy based on their preferences. The dataset contains messy real-world data with inconsistencies, requiring significant data cleaning and transformation. The goal of this project is to explore candy preferences and demographic patterns through data manipulation and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was collected through an open-ended survey where participants rated candies as **JOY (loved it), MEH (indifferent), or DESPAIR (disliked it)**. It also includes additional demographic information such as **age and trick-or-treating participation**.
 
## 🎯 Objectives
- **Clean and preprocess the dataset** (fix inconsistencies, remove unwanted characters, handle missing data). 
- **Analyze demographic trends** related to trick-or-treating and age distribution.
- **Explore sentiment analysis** on different candies.
- **Visualize findings** using data plots and tables.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Used
- **Python** for scripting and analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning Techniques** (handling missing values, renaming columns, fixing text inconsistencies)
- **Sentiment Analysis** using categorical survey responses

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Most loved and disliked candies based on survey responses.
- Relationship between age and trick-or-treating participation.
